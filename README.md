|Bass ukulele strings|1|pack| The ukulele is designed to fit all Thunder* aquila strings (Thundergut, Thunder Red, Thunderblack and Thunderbrown). I am not sure if wounded strings will work. https://aquilacorde.com/en/modern-music/bass-ukulele-ashbory-bass-strings/|
|Bass piezo pickup|1|piece| https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004965580868.html |'
|6x2 round neodymium magnet| 2|pcs| For holding in place tuning peg|
|KLT-10B tuner|1|piece|This was my choice because of the symetrical shape (no need to change the project for lefthanded version) and the output jack is mounted in round hole - so no need to alter the output hole for version with and without preamp. I haven't tested it yet but i hope the sound will be at least torelable. Bought mine here:  https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005033861676.html|
